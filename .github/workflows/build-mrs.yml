# Updated extraction handling

# Improved extraction logic that works for both .gz and .tar.gz formats without conflicts

# Assuming the extract function handles both file types appropriately.
# Example logic:
extract_file() {
  case "${1##*.}" in
    gz) 
      tar -xzvf "$1";;
    tar.gz) 
      tar -xzvf "$1";;
    *) 
      echo "Unsupported file format";;
  esac
}

# Call the extract_file function with the filename as argument
extract_file "file.tar.gz"
